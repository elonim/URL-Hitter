# URL Hitter
 
I needed a program to update a website once a day. To automatic update my ip with a dynamic DNS service.
I know that I easily could find a program that fulfilled all my needs. But as I am learning programming, I wanted to make my own instead. Feel free to use.


**Note to those who might be looking through my code.**

I also know that some parts of my code might be unnecessary complicated. Like I have used a singleton pattern instead of a static class or something else. But as I am learning I am just trying some different techniques.
